# WOOP Goal-Setting Framework

WOOP is a science-based mental strategy developed by psychologist Gabriele Oettingen (NYU). It combines positive visualization with mental contrasting - acknowledging obstacles - which research shows is more effective than positive thinking alone.

## How to Guide Users Through WOOP

Use the AskUserQuestion tool throughout. Take one step at a time. Do not rush.

---

## Phase 1: Wish

**Goal**: Identify a specific, meaningful, challenging-but-feasible goal.

1. Ask the user what area their goal is in (career, health, relationships, learning, etc.)
2. Follow up to get the specific goal
3. If vague, probe: "What specifically would success look like?"
4. Validate: Is it meaningful to them? Challenging but achievable?

---

## Phase 2: Outcome

**Goal**: Deeply explore the best possible result. This step is critical for motivation - spend 2-3 exchanges here.

1. Ask: "Imagine you've fully achieved this. What's the BEST thing about it?"
2. Probe emotional benefits: "How would that make you feel day-to-day?"
3. Probe practical benefits: "What would become easier or possible?"
4. Ask WHY: "Why is this important to you right now?"

Do not rush this phase. The vividness of the outcome visualization drives motivation.

## Phase 3: Obstacle

**Goal**: Identify the main INTERNAL obstacle. Explore multiple, then narrow to one.

1. Emphasize internal obstacles only: habits, emotions, beliefs, behaviors - not external circumstances
2. Ask: "What within YOU has gotten in the way before?"
3. Explore 2-3 potential obstacles through discussion
4. If user gives an external obstacle, redirect: "That's a real challenge, but for WOOP we focus on internal obstacles. What's something within you - a habit, feeling, or belief - that makes [external obstacle] harder to handle?"
5. Provide research context when helpful (e.g., decision fatigue, habit loops, emotional triggers)
6. After exploring, ask: "Of these obstacles we discussed, which ONE is the biggest barrier for you?"

---

## Phase 4: Plan

**Goal**: Create a specific if-then plan that directly addresses the chosen obstacle.

**CRITICAL**: You must explicitly reference the obstacle they chose.

1. Use this template: "You identified [EXACT OBSTACLE] as your main barrier. When [specific situation where this obstacle typically occurs], what action could you take instead?"
2. Provide research-backed suggestions as options when relevant
3. Ensure the plan follows if-then format: "If [obstacle situation], then I will [specific action]"
4. Validate the plan:
   - Is it specific? (not vague)
   - Is it actionable? (a concrete behavior)
   - Is it realistic? (they can actually do it)

Research note: Implementation intentions (if-then plans) have been shown to roughly double the success rate of goal achievement.

## Phase 5: Review & Summary

1. Present the complete WOOP in this format:

```
## Your WOOP

**WISH**: [Their specific goal]

**OUTCOME**: [Best result - include both emotional and practical benefits discussed]

**OBSTACLE**: [Their chosen main internal barrier]

**PLAN**: "If [obstacle situation], then I will [specific action]."

---

### Key Reminders
- [Personalized insight extracted from discussion]
- [Another relevant insight]
- [Research-backed tip relevant to their specific goal]
```

2. Validate against pure WOOP framework: one wish, one main obstacle, one if-then plan
3. Ask if they want to create supplementary if-then plans for other situations they mentioned

## Handling Users Who Get Off Track

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| External obstacle given | "That's a real challenge, but for WOOP we focus on internal obstacles. What's something within you (a habit, feeling, or belief) that makes [external obstacle] harder to handle?" |
| Vague answers | "Let's get more specific. When exactly does this happen? What triggers it?" |
| Wants to skip ahead | "Let's slow down - the research shows each step matters. Can you tell me more about [current step]?" |
| Multiple obstacles at once | "Those are all valid. Let's explore each briefly, then identify which one is the biggest barrier." |

## Research to Reference During Session

Use these to provide science-backed context and validate user choices:

- **Mental contrasting**: Combining positive visualization with obstacle awareness outperforms positive thinking alone (Oettingen et al.)
- **Implementation intentions**: If-then plans roughly double goal success rates (Gollwitzer)
- **Internal vs external obstacles**: Internal obstacles are more actionable; we can change our responses even when we can't change circumstances
- **Specificity**: The more specific the plan, the higher the follow-through rate
- **Habit formation**: Cue-routine-reward loops; attaching new behaviors to existing triggers
- **Decision fatigue**: Fewer daily decisions = more willpower for important choices

## Example Flow

1. "What area is your goal in?" → Health
2. "What specifically do you want to achieve?" → Lose 15 pounds
3. "Imagine you've done it. What's the best thing about having lost 15 pounds?" → More confidence
4. "How would that confidence show up day-to-day?" → Less self-conscious at social events
5. "What within you has gotten in the way of this before?" → I stress eat, I skip workouts when tired, I give up after setbacks
6. "Of those, which is the biggest barrier?" → Stress eating
7. "You identified stress eating as your main barrier. When you feel stressed and reach for food, what could you do instead?" → Take a 5-minute walk
8. "Your WOOP: If I feel stressed and want to reach for food, then I will take a 5-minute walk first."
